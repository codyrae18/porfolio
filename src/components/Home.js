          Hi Everyone, My name is Cody Lawdermilt and I’m originally from Leyte,
          Philippines. I moved to San Antonio, TX about two years ago to pursue
          my dream of becoming a software engineer. I recently graduated back
          home with a degree in Computer Engineering which actually gave me the
          inspiration to seek out more relevant skills. This curiosity led me to
          find a Coding bootcamp, and that lead me here to Flatiron School where
          I’ve learned so much in as little as 15 weeks! In the future I hope to
          further my knowledge and improve my skills and do what I love by
          creating platforms that incorporate my other passion, Photography.
